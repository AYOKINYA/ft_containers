# ft_containers
Reimpelement STL containers in C++98 version.

List

Vector

Map

Stack

Queue

+ bonus

Deque

Set

Multiset

cf) Multimap : works at Linux but seg fault at MacOS...

-------------------------

Every container depends on Iterator.hpp.

Stack, Queue and Deque are simplely made with List.

Multiset is a little variation of Set, allowing duplicate Keys.
